**Goal of the project**

This project aims to use the following dataset to gain insights on supermarket sales for retailers. Its looks at features of locations, supermarket type and size, items sold and its relation to outlet sales.

**Data Dictionary for this dataset**


|**Variable Name**|	**Description**|
| ----- | ----- |
|Item_Identifier|	Unique product ID|
|Item_Weight|	Weight of product|
|Item_Fat_Content|	Whether the product is low fat or regular|
|Item_Visibility|	The percentage of total display area of all products in a store allocated to the particular product|
|Item_Type|	The category to which the product belongs|

**Method of analysis**

Through out the project the following steps have been taken

-Data preparation & Processing using python

-Exploratory Data visualization using Mathplotlib and Seaborn

-Data processing and conditioning for Machine Learning with scaling, One hot encoding with pipeline and column transformations.

-Application of Machine learning methods eg Linear Regression, Regression tree and Random Forest in comparision to a baseline model.




**Recommendation**

Finally a recommendation are presented as a short presentation.
